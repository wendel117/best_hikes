# BestHikes

Welcome to Best Hikes of America! This application allows you to choose any state in the U.S. and learn about the top rated hike located in your chosen state. Learn about the top hikes in as many states as you want, and plan your next outdoor adventure!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'best_hikes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install best_hikes

## Usage

After reading the welcome message, type in "GO" and hit enter to view our list of all 50 states. Browse our list to find the state you'd like. Once you do, enter the number correlating to that state. The top hike for the chosen state will then appear, as well as a short description. After this, you will have the option to choose another state! Enter another state number or "list" to see the list again for reference. If you'd like to leave, enter exit!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
