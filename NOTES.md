CLI Project - Best hikes by State 

Scraping a website that shows the best hike per state, as well as a description about that hike. (exact location seems hard to scrape so might leave it off)

FLOW:

  -Welcome User
  -List states in Alphabetical order (which should be easy bc that's how they will be scraped)
  -ask user for input (make sure you ask for a number so no error in inputting maybe)
  -list the hike name and description.
  -prompt user to select list again to choose another state or exit to leave.
